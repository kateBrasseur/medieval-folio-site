Welcome to Carleton’s Compound Manuscript!

This digital edition of Ottawa, Carleton University Library, Archives and Research Collection MS. 1 (identified here as
the Carleton Compound manuscript) is presented here in three parts:

<ul>
    <li>A transcription of the manuscript’s text with adjacent images of each folium,</li> 
    <li> A codicological analysis of the manuscript focusing on its physical composition and palaeography,</li>
    <li>and an analysis of the manuscript’s contents</li> and an analysis of the manuscript’s contents
</ul>


These are meant to aid with the further research and to make Carleton’s oldest manuscript available for study.

Although this project in many ways follows the traditional standard of manuscript editions, it was born digital to
address the problems that come with the printed edition. These were chiefly access issues and the limitations to the
presentation of information. I discuss these challenges and particularities that come with digital projects in <a
    href="">How to Read This Edition in Part 2: Edition.</a>
To follow the process I took to undertake this project, and the decisions that were made along the way, including apps
used, find the project roadmap in the final two sections of Part 2: Edition.

You can also find the code for this website, and the xml files produced for the transcription as well as the code parser
for the Transkribus files on my Github.

Disclaimer: The final stages of this project were written under quarantine due to COVID-19 which prematurely ended my
access to the physical codex.
