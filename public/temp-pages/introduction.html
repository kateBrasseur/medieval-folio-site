What is a Medieval Manuscript?
In the European tradition, a medieval manuscript is a hand-made codex completed before the end of the Middle Ages (roughly 5th - 16th century CE). Often these are illuminated (hand-painted in metallic paints of gold and silver) and feature art within their margins as decorations. However, many are simple and use only black (or dark brown) and red inks. 

The contents were not as diverse as the modern book. Medieval manuscripts were most often religious books within the Christian tradition but Judaic and Islamic codices were also present. The codices could also contain philosophical works (Plato and Aristotle being a popular topic).

What is the Carleton Compound manuscript?
Ottawa, Carleton University Library, Archives and Research Collection MS. 1 (referred to here as Carleton Compound manuscript) is a compound manuscript that is made up of two separate manuscripts that were created at different times bound together.

The codex, including both manuscripts, is a Christian chant manuscript which features both plainchant and written word. The first manuscript, which will be referred to as part A, includes a Tonary, followed by sections from the Canonical hours (or Liturgy of the Hours): the Office of the Dead and various Feast Days. However, the second manuscript (part B) is a hymnal, demonstrating a clear distinction from part A.
