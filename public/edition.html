		<h1>Part 2: Edition</h1>
		<h2>How to read this edition</h2>
		<p>
			This transcription of the manuscript’s text is a visual reproduction, and a Diplomatic Edition. This means
			that what you see on the images on the left hand side was transcribed on the right with scribal mistakes,
			special and abbreviated characters, and punctuation or lack thereof left in the final product. This is not a
			critical edition, which would be the product of studying multiple manuscripts to construct a final version
			with the cumulative information from each codex with the purpose of studying its contents rather than the
			specific manuscript’s history. This edition, as it lives in the digital realm, can also be referred to as a
			Hypertext edition, because of the nonlinear presentation of information that can be achieved through the
			digital format unlike traditional print texts.

		</p>
		<h2>Privileging transcription over finished edition</h2>

		<p>
			The benefit of this is that researchers can easily study the paleographical and codicological aspects of
			this manuscript. This decision was made because Carleton Compound manuscript is quite standard in its
			contents, but rather unique in its physical composition (more information on this in the physical
			description section). The decision to make the edition digital was in large part a question of access,
			especially because Carleton University, as a Canadian institution, must rely heavily on digital content for
			the study of European manuscripts.

		</p>
		<h2>Digital Format</h2>

		<p>
			Because of the digital format, the text can be shown in numerous ways without compromising user experience,
			i.e. the reader does not need to constantly refer to the index and appendices at the back of a paper copy to
			make sense of the text. As you will see, in order to unpack an abbreviation or symbol as presented in the
			manuscript in the transcription, the user must simply hover over the word or symbol to have it unpacked
			(with the exception of common usage symbols, as listed in the table below).

		<h2>Image files</h2>

		<p>
			The images found on the website were originally produced in TIFF but from a web-friendly point of view, the
			images had to be cropped and resized to allow for quick load times on the website. This comes from a user
			experience (UX) stand-point to ensure the largest group of scholars would have access to the images rather
			than the few with high download speeds and large amounts of available RAM. The images are still high-quality
			enough for the detailed scrutiny required in manuscript studies and are available for download for scholars
			to quickly and frequently access.

		</p>
		<p>
			These images were taken with a digital camera, but in future we hope to produce scans of the manuscript.
			Unfortunately we did not have access to a large enough scanner at the time of this project. This presented
			unique challenges because the orientation, lighting, and dimensions of each image were distinct. In other
			words, each of the 148 original images would have to be manually manipulated. Therefore, a batch image
			processor was used to crop the images to a standard size. This allowed the website to display the folios in
			a streamline and consistent fashion, giving the reader a book-like experience despite the vastly different
			sizes and orientation of the original images. As you will see, the result was not perfect, but far easier to
			read in the final version.

		</p>




		<h2>Web Edition vs Paper Version</h2>
		<p>
			When I was first introduced to the Carleton Compound manuscript in 2016 Carleton University’s Archives and
			Research Collections had not yet digitally catalogued any of their medieval materials, nor do they exist in
			the library's catalogue. For researchers, it is as if the manuscript does not exist. This project sought to
			address this problem by creating an online edition for the codex, circumventing the issues with access
			intrinsic to the printed edition.

		</p>
		<h2>Broader Access</h2>
		<p>
			Some of these fundamental issues are that the commentary and glossary are usually separate from the
			transcription, segregated to the end of the paperback, often rendering it cumbersome for reference.
			Furthermore, a printed work must be produced, published, and distributed before it is accessible to
			scholars. Electronic editions, however, change this process – making editions not a product but a process
			that can be published online while in progress to allow other scholars to make use of the work and possibly
			to contribute to it. In essence, once the work is online and accessible (usually through an institution) it
			is catalogued and therefore referenceable, unlike projects which are left to languish gathering dust within
			the shelves upon shelves of uncatalogued theses.

		</p>
		<p>
			Scholars of medieval liturgy and codicology can know of the manuscript’s existence and perhaps reveal some
			of its long-held secrets through this diplomatic edition. Found on this bespoke website created with the
			purpose of showcasing this manuscript in ways suited to its study as both object and text.

		</p>
		<h2>Open Source</h2>
		<p>
			This project embraces the idea of collaboration and transparency in the digital realm and builds upon the
			developments of digital academics in the field of manuscript studies. That is why all stages of this project
			were accomplished using largely open source and free to use software. Furthermore, all the code purpose
			written for this project is available to others to use and modify for their own future projects via Github.

		</p>
		<h2>Editorial Decisions</h2>
		<p>
			This was the first step in the project, to generate a transcription that would be workable for research into
			the contents of the manuscript. However, the first draft of the transcription was a lesson in editorial
			decision making. When and how should I use unicode characters to represent unique Latin letter forms?
			-How and why use unicode characters
			-Why only the primary book was transcribed (lack of fragment transcription) I only transcribed the main text
			My goal was to focus on the lit. ...this is the provisional ...this is work that can be done still...

		</p>

		<h2>Transkribus </h2>
		<p>
			Transkribus is a tool that automatically recognizes lines of hand written text to make transcribing
			historical documents into XML easier. The ability to render the text in XML also provides scholars with the
			ability to tag structural and textual elements of the document to more easily reproduce these elements when
			connected with a purpose made CSS. This program is open access (free to use) and most of the source code is
			open source, find more on the Transkribus github page.

		</p>
		<h2>Tool and Source Code</h2>
		<p>
			Code exported from Transkribus is available in XML which includes all the locational data from the
			software’s layout analysis tools. Because this was not key to this project, a code parser was developed to
			clean up the XML and produce an HTML version of the transcription purpose built for this website.
			The HTML, JS and CSS for the website can all be found on my Github.
		</p>

		<h2>Heroku</h2>
		<p>
			Heroku is a cloud application platform that allows users to manage their servers for free. The decision to
			make a bespoke website for this project posed a significant issue: where would I serve the images and source
			code? Heroku provides this service for free. It is also well documented and has a large community for
			support resources that can help students (and non-developers) to use the platform and troubleshoot problems
			as they arise.

		</p>
		<h2>Stages of Production</h2>
		<p>
			In order to illustrate the process of creating a born-digital manuscript edition, I have provided a roadmap
			for this project below. Here I discuss the methods and guidelines I consulted and I reflect on the
			limitations and advantages of the various software and platforms I used throughout this process. For more
			information on editorial decisions made throughout this project please see How to Read this Edition.

		</p>
		<h2>Using Transkribus</h2>
		<p>
			Before I could begin to start pulling research into a cohesive place, I needed a workable transcription of
			the Carleton compound manuscript. In order to create a digital transcription of the manuscript, I needed a
			robust tool that could serve over 130 high quality images and would preferably be an open access (free to
			use) tool. Developers at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, had developed a tool, Transkribus, that met
			nearly all my specifications. This tool automatically recognizes historical written and printed text and
			builds an intuitive structure around textual elements to make transcription easier. Importantly, it hosts
			users’ images to the Transkribus server to create “private collections” that limit access to the original
			user and those they chose to share their collection with. Moreover, the tool allows scholars to write in any
			language using any character set (this project required the extended Latin unicode alphabet).

		</p>
		<p>
			The major caveat of using the Transkribus software was its output format. Transkribus outputs hundreds of
			lines of XML code containing a proprietary string format that represents the coordinates of each identified
			element of text (including rubrication, position of lines of text, drop capitals, etc.). The string format
			does not follow XML standards and therefore required a custom parser (which can be found on my Github page)
			that detected the location information of the various tags (indicating the important textual elements of the
			document) for it to be correctly displayed on the website.

		</p>
		<h2>Working with the XML files</h2>
		<p>
			Transkribus exports in several formats, including TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), PDF, and XML (Extensible
			Markup Language). TEI guidelines, the ideal for many digital humanists, define and shape the XML format to
			be compatible between digital humanities projects. The payload of this initiative is a vigorous tagging
			system that documents and describes structural and textual elements of virtually any type of document.
			Transkribus includes many of these tags within the program and these have been largely maintained in the
			final HTML for this project, which you can find on my Github page. As mentioned in the previous section,
			“Using Transkribus”, Transkribus outputs XML code containing a proprietary string format that does not
			follow XML standards. Therefore, in order for the code to display accurately on the website, a custom parser
			(found here) that detected the location information for the various tags (indicating the important textual
			elements of the document) was purpose built to work with Transkribus’ XML output. This custom parser
			outputted directly into the HTML used for the website (found here).

		<p>Creating the Website </p>
		-Why a purpose built website and not wordpress, etc?


		<h2>Cantus Database</h2>
		-How was the Cantus database used?

		<h2>Conclusions</h2>
		<p>
			Digital projects are more of a process than a final product, and as such are constantly evolving. What has
			been done sets the foundations for further research and further questions. Chief among these for me are,
			where to go from here?
			Ideally, the next steps for this project would be to:

		</p>

		<p>
			Transcribe the fragments used as manuscript waste that can be found throughout the codex to deepen our
			understanding of the book’s history and provenance.
			Crowdsource the musical notation for this codex. Having no musical experience myself, I made the decision
			not to attempt a transcription of the musical notation found in this chant manuscript. A logical next step
			for this project would therefore be a transcription of the manuscript’s plainchant and subsequent
			integration into the Cantus database.
			Integrate into the Cantus database (explanation of Cantus database and what is involved in integration)
