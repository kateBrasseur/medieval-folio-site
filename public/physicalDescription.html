        <h2>Physical Description of Ms.1</h2>

        <h3>Mise-en-page (page measurements)</h3>
        -to be divide section into part A (main ms) and part B (second ms)

        <p>Carleton Compound manuscript’s folios generally have a width of 28.6 cm and a length of 38.2 cm. Each folio
            is
            written in a single column of six lines of text with six corresponding musical notations. Each of these
            musical
            notations consists of four-lined staves and has a width of 20.1 cm and a length of 27.5 cm.</p>

        <p>The margins are 3.1 cm on the interior and 5.4 cm on the outer margin. The spacing from the top is 2.1 cm and
            8.6 cm
            from the bottom with exceptions where the folios have worn down. (Figure #)</p>

        <p>
            The final folios, *LIST*, added at a later date, differ from the standard layout as well as from each other.
            The
            variations are slight for the most part, usually only between 0.2 and 0.6cm difference. Folio 63r-64v
            features
            slanted lines for musical notation, a difference of 0.4 cm from one end to the other. These features could
            indicate
            that the manuscript is the product of folios taken from another manuscript to replace missing or damaged
            folios over
            time or for the purpose of resale in the modern manuscript market.

        </p>

        <h3>Binding</h3>
        <p>
            Carleton Compound manuscript is composed of seven quires of eight leaves each. However, many quires now have
            missing
            leaves leaving a total of 65 leaves. The fourth quire has both the fifth and sixth leaves removed, appearing
            to be
            cut out with scissors leaving jagged edges (Figure #). The eighth quire has additional folios that were
            added at a
            later date, 63r to 65v. Quire nine has three removed folios, likely cut with a book-breaking specific tool
            as the
            edges are quite smooth (Figure #).

        </p>
        <p>
            The binding is currently in a state of deterioration. The front cover and initial quire detached as a result
            of use
            in 2017. It was rebound most recently circa 1950. It is a leather-wrapped cardboard binding with muslin
            added to
            reinforce the spine of the manuscript (Figure #).

        </p>

        <h3>Palaeography (Scribal Hands)</h3>
        <p>
            The manuscript features three distinct book hands. Additionally, at least one early modern and one modern
            script can
            be found in the margins of the codex.

        </p>
        <p>
            The first ranging from 1R - 41V; 43V - 61V is an example of 15th-century Southern Textualis (Rotunda) with
            Spanish
            features such as:
            <ul>
                <li>The ‘a’ which closes its upper lobe with a spiralling hairline. (Figure #)</li>
                <li>The usage of ‘et’ in full. Italian Rotunda features the Tironian ‘et’. In Spain, these fusions were
                    rarely
                    used. This manuscript features no Tironian ‘et’ in the Rotunda Book Hand. (Figure #)</li>
                <li>The straight ‘s’ done in two strokes, sometimes barely or only partially connected, is
                    characteristic of
                    southern European book hands. (Figure #)</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This book hand also helps us date the manuscript. The straight ‘d’ emerged in Spain gradually replacing the
            uncial
            ‘d’ due to Humanistic influence occurring between 1460-1500.
            Across Iberia, during the 15th century onward scribes often included decorative hairlines on the final
            letter of
            important words. (Figure #)
            These place this portion of the manuscript after 1460, it was likely completed in the early to mid-1500s as
            we see
            Humanist influences emerging in the letterforms.

        </p>
        <p>
            The second book hand ranging from 42R - 43R, is a Hybrida script. The single-compartment ‘a’ (Figure #) and
            a
            somewhat triangular form with a pointed top indicates it as a Hybrida script. The exclusive use of the
            unlooped ‘d’
            and a distinct lack of approach stroke or other decoration on ascenders is distinctive of 16th-century
            Hybrida. The
            addition of a fifth staff line in the musical notation (Figure #), as well as the use of the later Tirontian
            ‘et’
            (Figure #), demonstrates that this script was likely added to the original manuscript leaves a while after
            the
            original script was completed.

        </p>
        <p>
            The third book hand is another form of southern textualis but with distinct differences to the first book
            hand. It
            is found on quires that were added to the manuscript at a later date. It is much more angular and commonly
            uses the
            half-uncial ‘d’. These features point to an origin outside of Iberia as the half-uncial ‘d’ is not found in
            Spain or
            Portugal between the 13th and 15th century.

        <h3>Writing Support</h3>
        <p>
            The parchment has many physical attributes from the animal itself including naturally occurring holes which
            indicates that this codex’s usage was likely practical rather than for display or for a wealthy patron.
            Furthermore,
            the manuscript demonstrates considerable wear as a result of extended use such as stains, ink and liquid
            damage, as
            well as minor burns.

        </p>
        <p>
            The black-brown ink used on the manuscript has caused small holes to appear in the parchment. This is likely
            because
            tannic acid was used to create the ink, a compound found in many medieval inks.

        </p>
        <h3>Repairs and Additions</h3>

        <p>The manuscript demonstrates long use and a long history of repairs — indicating the continuing use of the
            manuscript.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eighteen leaves show signs of minor water damage. Glue damage is more common, seen on twenty-four leaves of
            the
            manuscript.

        </p>
        <p>
            The first three leaves feature an acidic burn, likely from a copper or iron nail that made up the original
            cover of
            the manuscript. This would have caused the acidic breakdown of the parchment over time (Figure #).

        </p>
        <p>
            The leaves demonstrate extensive wear on the corners of the pages. In some cases, such as the fourth leaf
            (f.4),
            wear has been so extreme that the parchment had to be reinforced (Figure 1.4).

        </p>
        <p>
            Considerable repairs are present including stitching, reinforced parchment, and revised text where damages
            or
            mistakes are located. Twenty-two of the leaves have been reinforced with fragments (or manuscript waste)
            from
            various sources including early printed books. These are typically both glued and stitched onto the original
            parchment. Stitching was completed by various handlers over time, evident in the range of skill and
            materials used
            to do so. Notably, reinforcements are concentrated in the first third of the manuscript, with tears left
            unstitched
            in the latter two thirds.

        </p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>

        <p>
            The codicology analysis of the manuscript reveals that it is a compound manuscript featuring at least two
            quires of
            distinct origins, and at least three book hands. The first and largest part of the codex is of Spanish
            origin and
            dates from the early to mid 1500s. It was created for practical use, suggested from the quality of the
            parchment
            used and the extended usage and repairs that can be observed. It was an instructional manuscript intended to
            teach
            monks how to sing the eight modes of Gregorian chant, evident in the appended tonary (see Contents). It was
            further
            used as a teaching tool in that it was stitched and calligraphed by amateur monks, apparent in the
            inconsistent
            quality of both repairs and script.

        </p>
        <p>
            The manuscript received special care by it’s original, likely monastic, owners. It is free of insect,
            rodent, or
            mold damage which suggests the initial owners took care to house the manuscript appropriately. The extended
            usage
            and subsequent repairs signify a position of practical, yet still great importance to the owners.

        </p>
        <p>
            There is evidence of book breaking and modern edits at several points throughout the object’s history. This
            means
            the codex changed hands a few times after leaving its place of origin and prior to its arrival at Carleton.
            This is
            likely when the final quire, which could be as early as c. 1300s, was appended to the back of the codex.
            This was
            likely done for the purpose of resale.
