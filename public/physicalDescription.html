            <h1>Physical Description of the Carleton Antiphonary</h1>
            <hr class="una" />
            <br />
            <p>The Carleton Antiphonary is a codex which is composed of two manuscripts bound together, with a distinct
                final page appended to the end. The codex is made up of 65 folios (130 pages). The text is copied in a
                single column of six lines in black ink with six corresponding four-line staves in red ink, with the
                exception of the final page where 5-line staves appear. There are no page numbers present on either of
                the manuscripts nor the final page. The primary manuscript or part A (f.1r - 61v) is consistent with an
                Iberian late-fifteenth/early sixteenth-century provenience. The second, much smaller manuscript, part B
                (f.63r - 64v) corresponds with 14th-century gothic quadrata manuscripts copied in southern Europe.
                Carleton Antiphonary also features a curiously distinct final page (65r-65v) which may be the result of
                a different scribe or could be from another separate manuscript and is compatible with southern European
                Rotunda manuscripts. The following physical description, therefore, is divided into three parts: part A
                and part B and the final page which is dealt with separately from the two larger parts for clarity.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h4>Part A (Primary manuscript)</h4>
            <p>The first and largest manuscript that makes up the Carleton Antiphonary ranges from f.1R - 61V (133
                folios). The folios have a height of 382 mm and a width of 286 mm.<a href="#_ftn1"
                    name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> The text is copied in a single column of six lines
                with six corresponding four-line staves.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>
                The margins are 31 mm wide on the interior margin and 54 mm on the outer. The height from the top of the
                page to the top of the first line of music is 21 mm and 86 mm from the bottom of the final line of text
                to the bottom of the page. Some slight variation exists when the folios have been worn down or cropped.
                There are no page numbers present on either of the manuscripts. There is a single guideword in the
                primary bookhand present throughout the manuscript found in part A on folio 8v (Figure 1). This folio
                marks the end of quire 1.</p>
            <p>But there are several guidewords found in the margins in a lighter, brown, ink, discussed in more detail
                below.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail rounded mx-auto d-block"" src="/img/Figures/figure-1.jpg">
            <p class="image-caption">(Figure 1: <em>guideword in primary bookhand, black in on folio 8v)</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Part B (Secondary manuscript)</h4>
            <p>The final folios (f.63r - 65v) differ from the standard layout of part A as well as from each other. The
                leaves are slightly smaller than part A &mdash;roughly 281mm in width and 378 mm in height. Unlike the
                very standardized size of Part A, the folios of part B show slight variations between 2 and 6 mm
                difference. Folio 63r-64v features slanted lines for musical notation, a difference of 4 mm from one end
                to the other. This is an indication that this manuscript may be earlier than part A, copied at a time
                when lines were drawn by hand or after drypoint ruling rather than by plummet (leadpoint) ruling, which
                left visible lines on the page (like shown here on Figure 3, in part A).&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Final page</h4>
            <p>Curiously, the final leaf (f.65r - 65v) features five-line staves which are not present at any other
                point in the manuscript (other than on the later added manuscript fragments used for repairs or
                annotation, discussed below).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 id=binding>1.2 Binding</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>The binding is currently deteriorating. The front cover and initial quire detached as a result of use in
                2017. It is unclear when the manuscripts were rebound together to create the compound manuscript but
                perhaps a more in-depth study of the binding method and materials used could provide clarity. It is a
                leather-wrapped cardboard binding with a cotton fabric added to reinforce the spine of the manuscript
                (Figure 2).</p>

            <p>Carleton Antiphonary is composed of ten quires comprised of eight folios each, except where pages have
                been removed, see the following table:</p>

            <p>This results in a total number of 65 folios throughout ten quires. Therefore, there are a total fifthteen
                missing or removed pages. Quire 4 has one removed leaf from the current binding (between f.28v - 29r),
                cut out which have left imprecise edges (Figure 3). Quire 5 has a missing page which was removed prior
                to current binding (between f.33v - 34r.). Quire 8, the final quire of part A (between f.61v - 62r) has
                its final leaf removed with a jagged cut from scissors (figure 4). Quire 9, or part B, has had its final
                five leaves removed prior to the current binding (between 64v - 65r). Finally, quire 10 is a standalone
                leaf (and therefore missing seven leaves) which is likely a distinct leaf sourced from a separate
                manuscript which has been appended to the end of the Carleton Antiphonary, which will be discussed more

            <h3 id=palaeography>1.3 Palaeography (Scribal Hands) and Ink</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>Carleton Antiphonary features three distinct bookhands. The main bookhand (bookhand 1) is a Spanish
                Rotunda script from the fifteenth century. The second bookhand (bookhand 2) appears to be a Humanist
                script, copied much later onto the original parchment. The third and final bookhand (bookhand 3) appears
                on manuscript part B (the manuscript appended to the end of the main manuscript) and is an early form
                (likely fourteenth century) of Southern Textualis, a script found in southern Europe.</p>
            <p>Curiously, the final leaf (f. 65r - 65v) returns to a Rotunda script featuring very rounded letterforms.
                Although we see differences between scribal hands in the primary manuscript, this presents a significant
                departure from those letterforms. The rubrication is also distinct, with added features to accompany
                five-line staves, which are also unique to the final leaf. It will be treated separately from the
                primary bookhand for these reasons.</p>
            <p>Additionally, at least one early modern and one modern script can be found in the margins and in line
                with the text of the manuscript.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Bookhand 1 (f. 1r - 42r; 44r - 61v)</h4>
            <p>The first and most widely used bookhand in the codex, this bookhand is an example of fifteenth-century
                Southern Textualis (Rotunda). It features uniquely Spanish characteristics such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The &lsquo;a&rsquo; which closes its upper lobe with a spiralling hairline. (Figure 5)</li>
                <li>The usage of &lsquo;et&rsquo; in full. Italian Rotunda features the Tironian &lsquo;et&rsquo;. In
                    Spain, these fusions were rarely used. This manuscript features no Tironian &lsquo;et&rsquo; in the
                    Rotunda Book Hand.</li>
                <li>The straight &lsquo;s&rsquo; done in two strokes, sometimes barely or only partially connected, is
                    characteristic of southern European book hands. (Figure 6)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This bookhand helps us date part A of the manuscript as we see similarities in letterforms and aesthetics
                of Spanish chant manuscripts from 1501-1600 (<em>see</em> plates 1-5). Furthermore, during the
                fourteenth century onward Iberian scribes often included characteristic decorative hairlines on the
                final letter of important words which can be seen throughout the first bookhand (Figure 7).<a
                    href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> This palaeographical evidence suggests
                that this part of the manuscript (part A) was copied after the mid fifteenth but certainly by the
                mid-sixteenth century.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            </div>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Bookhand 2 (f. 42r - 43r)</h4>
            <p>The second bookhand is a half-cursiva script. This hand is clearly a later and less polished addition to
                the manuscript. Bookhand 1 ends the text halfway through f. 42r, but lined the musical staves on folios
                42r - 43v. Bookhand 2 adds the text and music from the <em>Kyrie </em>to these existing staves. The dark
                brown ink and the irregular letter forms show a marked difference from Bookhand 1. The scribe seems
                unpractised in comparison to the professional and very regular letterforms of both bookhands 1 and 3.
                The single-compartment &lsquo;a&rsquo; (Figure 8) and a somewhat triangular form with a pointed top
                indicates it as a Hybrida script. The script was developed in the mid-sixteenth century as a result of a
                growing middle class need for a faster script than textualis.<a href="#_ftn5"
                    name="_ftnref5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> The addition of a fifth staff line in the musical
                notation, as well as the use of the later Tirontian &lsquo;et&rsquo; (Figure 9), demonstrates that this
                script was added to the original manuscript leaves a time after the original script was copied.</p>

            <h4>Bookhand 3 (f. 62r - 64v)</h4>
            <p>The third bookhand is found in part B of the codex which the codicological evidence suggests is a
                separate manuscript bound together with Part A at a later date (see <em>binding</em>). It is a form of
                southern textualis with distinct differences to Bookhand 1. It is much more angular than the Rotunda,
                and each letter is created using multiple pen strokes to create gothic minimums. It is likely a less
                formal form of Gothic Quadrata, as miniums are present but often inconsistent.<a href="#_ftn6"
                    name="_ftnref6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Bookhand 4 (f.65r - 65v)</h4>
            <p>Bookhand 4 is another Rotunda script with features that make it distinct from the Rotunda script from
                Bookhand 1. The letterforms are thicker, less angular, and shorter than the Rotunda of Bookhand 1.
                Although Bookhand 1 features multiple different forms of the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; but each follows a
                particular style (Figure 10.2-3) Bookhand 4 features an &lsquo;a&rsquo; that is unlike that of the
                typical Spanish Rotunda form (Figure 10.4). This difference is more clear when compared to Spanish
                Rotunda scripts from around the same date (Plates 1 - 4).</p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block" src="/img/Figures/figure-10.jpg" style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <p class="image-caption">(Figure 10: <em>a comparison of the &lsquo;a&rsquo; letterforms from Bookhand 1 (.1-.3) and Bookhand 4 (.4)

                <em>Benedicamus Domino y v&iacute;speras de santos (plate 1)</em> f.1r</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In fact, it is likely that this final leaf was copied at a different time, likely later than Bookhand 1
                or Bookhand 3 (an angular southern textualis) which precedes it in the manuscript. If this script is
                connected to Bookhand 1, this could be the result of a different scribe and rubricator, but the
                inclusion of five-line staves, a departure in musical style (inclusion of melismatic notes) and the fact
                that early modern collectors often replaced the final leaf of manuscripts with less damaged leaves to
                make the manuscript appear more complete, reinforce the idea that this leaf came from a separate
                manuscript.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a></p>

            <hr/>
            <h4>Contemporary Annotations (f.3v, 6v, 12v, 21v 28r, 30v, 44r, 45r)</h4>
            <p>A few small marginal notes can be found in the early half of part A of the compound manuscript. These are
                likely guidewords as they appear alongside the heading of each new mode of the tonary (between 3v - 21v)
                and are not written in the same black ink as the bookhands, but a lighter brown ink. The small size of
                the text suggests a very fine writing tool was used to add the text to the parchment (figure 11). In
                some places, the marginal notes may have been cut off during binding or perhaps were never added.</p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block figure-intext" src="/img/Figures/figure-11.jpg">
            <p class="image-caption">(Figure 11: <em>marginal annotation, guidewords on f.6v</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another contemporary annotation was the addition of a three-line stave and what appears to be an
                alternate musical notation for the Kyriel. This can be found in the bottom margin of f.30v and is meant
                to blend in somewhat with the rest of the page (Figure 12).</p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block figure-intext" src="/img/Figures/figure-12.jpg">
            <p class="image-caption">(Figure 12: <em>marginal annotation, additional musical notation on f.30v)</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Similar marginal guidewords (as those found in the tonary) appear again on f.44r and 45r. Again, these
                correspond with headings. These annotations are paired with the rubricated headings &ldquo;Sabbato in
                aduentum domini. Hymnus&rdquo; (figure 13), &ldquo;ad nona&rdquo; (both found on f.44r) and &ldquo;in
                epiphania domini&rdquo; (f.45r).</p>

            <p class="image-caption">(figure 13: <em>guideword and paired rubrication from folio 44r)</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Early Modern Annotations (f.37r, 39r)</h4>
            <p>Written in the same pen as the Bookhand 2, the early modern (hybrida) script found between f. 42r - 43r,
                these annotations were interested in expanding upon the music as well as the text. The kyrie eleison was
                expanded on f.37r (figure 14) and a single line of music and corresponding chant was added to 39r. The
                annotation, although appearing to be attempting to expand the text, the addition of <em>biblios </em>was
                not found in other instances of the Office of the Dead (figure 15).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block" src="/img/Figures/figure-14.jpg">

            <p class="image-caption">(Figure 15: <em>exterior margin of f.39r)</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Modern Annotations (27r, 27v, 28r, 34v)</h4>
            <p>The modern annotations found on f.27r - 28r are written with a lead pencil in a modern cursive script.
                These annotations are meant to expand abbreviations or make corrections but are often incorrect. For
                example, &ldquo;animum tuaᴈ&rdquo; is written as &ldquo;animus tuas&rdquo; (f.27v).</p>
            <p>Interestingly, on f.34v although also a modern script, attempts to imitate the rotunda script. The
                annotator has written the correction on a blank piece of manuscript with a dull brown ink and glued the
                annotation on top of the original script.</p>

            <p>The Antiphonary, in addition to being the product of multiple manuscripts for the main book, also has
                many repairs that were made using manuscript fragments. It is common to see reinforcements and repairs
                of the holes and damages in this manuscript done with manuscript waste, which are pieces of parchment
                from liturgical texts deemed outdated.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a></p>

               <h3 id=initials-and-rubrication>1.6 Initials and Rubrication</h3>
               <hr/>
            <p>This codex, like most medieval manuscripts, uses a system of capital letters and initials, rubricated or
                not, to signify different textual elements. Two types of initial letters (sometimes called drop capitals
                because they often take up the space of two lines instead of one) exist in this manuscript, the
                rubricated initial and the plain initial (copied in the same ink as the rest of the manuscript text).
                Capital letters exist in two forms as well, partially rubricated and a plain capital. In many liturgical
                manuscripts such as antiphonals rubricated abbreviations, such as ps for psalm, also signifies a new
                textual element. See table 4 for details.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Tonary</h4>
            <p>In the tonary, each of the eight modes, indicated by a rubricated heading, start with a rubricated
                initial. These rubricated initials or drop capitals are flush with the baseline of the text but take up
                the space of an entire stave or sometimes go a bit beyond it. The next level is a plain initial, which
                is always preceded by a rubricated abbreviation such as Ꝟ (verse). The third and final level is the
                plain capital which marks the beginning of a new sentence within a verse.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Antiphonal</h4>
            <p>The antiphonal follows a similar structure to the tonary with a few key additions. Each major heading
                starts with a rubricated initial (drop capital) that is flush with the baseline of the text but takes up
                the space of an entire stave or sometimes goes a bit beyond it. Antiphons, signified by a rubricated a
                with an extended crossline, are directly followed by a plain initial. Psalms (rubricated ps or sometimes
                p̄) however, are only followed by a plain capital, placing them within the hierarchy of the antiphon.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Hymnal</h4>
            <p>Each major heading, indicated by a rubricated heading of the hymnal, starts with a rubricated initial. A
                plain initial is used to begin the final refrain of the hymn. Interestingly, the hymnal does not use
                white space, but instead employs rubricated symbols between syllable units to indicate melisma as
                evident by the quick succession of notes that typically appear above it (figure 16).</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Final Leaf (Antiphonal)</h4>
            <p>Antiphons, signified by a rubricated an̄, are directly followed by a plain initial. Psalms (rubricated
                p̄s) are also followed by a plain initial. I wish more could be said about this unusual leaf, but we
                have only one page to study.</p>

            <hr/>
            <p>The parchment has many physical attributes from the animal itself including naturally occurring holes
                (figure 17) which indicates that this codex&rsquo;s usage was likely practical rather than for display
                or for a wealthy patron. Furthermore, the manuscript demonstrates considerable wear as a result of
                extended use such as stains, ink and liquid damage, as well as minor burns. For example, the black-brown
                ink used on the manuscript has caused small holes to appear in the parchment. This is likely because
                tannic acid was used to create the ink, a compound found in many medieval inks.<a href="#_ftn22"

            <h3 id=damages-repairs-and-additions>1.8 Damages, Repairs and Additions</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>The manuscript demonstrates long use and a long history of repairs &mdash; indicating the continued use
                of the manuscript. Roughly eighteen leaves show signs of minor water damage. But glue damage is more
                common, seen on approximately twenty-four leaves of the manuscript.</p>
            <p>Glue damages may have occurred during the many repairs done to the manuscript, especially when fragments
                or manuscript waste were applied to the parchment. We know that the manuscript was likely in the hands
                of an early modern collector because of the composite nature of the manuscript. The process of unbinding
                and rebinding the quires to create the Carleton Antiphonary may have exposed the manuscript to glue.
                This is buttressed by the fact that dried pieces of glue were left on one leaf but they did not stain or
                stick to the leaf facing it (such as f.8v - 9r). Furthermore, glue damage is found on leaves that do not
                have fragments or manuscript waste (such as 7v, seen in fig. 23.2) This evidence indicates that these
                damages occurred when the manuscript was unbound.</p>

            <p>Folio 13r has suffered moisture damage that has resulted in the ink bleeding, strangely it does not
                affect the entire page equally (figure 18).</p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block figure-intext" src="/img/Figures/figure-18.jpg">
            <p class="image-caption">(Figure 18: f.13r <em>showing water damage causing the ink to bleed.)</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The first three leaves feature an acidic burn, possibly from a copper or iron nail that made up the
                original cover of the manuscript. This would have caused the acidic breakdown of the parchment over time
                (Figure 19.1).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail rounded mx-auto d-block figure-intext" src="/img/Figures/figure-19.jpg">
            <p style="text-align:center;" class="image-caption">(Figure 19: From right to left: f.1r, f.7v, f.21r showing various damages.)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The leaves demonstrate extensive wear on the corners of the pages. In some cases, such as folio 21r, wear
                has been so extreme that the parchment had to be reinforced (Figure 19.3).</p>
            <p>Considerable repairs are present including stitching, reinforced parchment, and rewritten text where
                repairs or mistakes demanded it. Twenty-two of the leaves have been reinforced with fragments (or
                manuscript waste) from various sources including printed materials on paper. These are typically both
                glued and stitched onto the original parchment. Stitching was completed by various handlers over time,
                evident in the range of skill and materials used to do so. Notably, reinforcements are concentrated in
                the first third of the manuscript, with tears left unstitched in the latter two thirds.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 id=provenance>1.9 Provenance</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>The primary manuscript (part A) of the codex was copied in Spain in the early to mid-sixteenth century.
                The inclusion of prayers dedicated to the veneration of the Virgin Mary (f. 59v-60r; 61v; 65r-65v) point
                to Catholic monastic tradition but Franciscan origin is not impossible.</p>
            <p>The secondary manuscript (part B) of the codex was likely copied earlier, possibly the fifteenth century.
                It was copied in southern Europe, likely from Southern France or perhaps Italy. The earliest secure
                evidence of provenance comes from a type-written donation plate glued to the interior of the front cover
                of the manuscript, reading:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14th CENTURY MANUSCRIPT</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donated by Fr. McDougall, O.M.I.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1960</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The bookplate indicates the manuscript was a gift of Father Hugh Andrew McDougall, (b. 1922, d.2012) in
                1960, a member of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate (est. 1826) who was soon thereafter to become the Dean
                of Saint Patrick&rsquo;s College (from 1961-67 and again in 1973-76). This Order had a strong presence
                in England, Ireland and Canada, especially among the Irish Canadians in the Ottawa region. The Oblates
                has supported this college as a missionary venture for the order in Canada.<a href="#_ftn23"
                    name="_ftnref23"><sup><sup>[23]</sup></sup></a> MacDougall perhaps obtained the codex while
                completing his PhD (completed 1960) at Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge University. This independent
                Catholic college run by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Ottawa became a part of Carleton University in
                1967. Due to financial problems, St. Patrick&rsquo;s College was dissolved in 1979, with its assets
                taken over by Carleton University, so it is likely it was at this time that the manuscript entered
                Carleton&rsquo;s collection.</p>
            <p>Although we lack evidence to indicate when or how the codex may have left Spain or southern Europe, there
                are possible explanations. We know from the donation plate that the codex must have been acquired by
                McDougall prior to 1960. Medieval objects were often subject to theft during the wartime period and may
                have been displaced when British soldiers returned home from the Spanish Civil War.<a href="#_ftn24"
                    name="_ftnref24"><sup><sup>[24]</sup></sup></a> It is also possible that British soldiers may have
                brought it to England from southern Europe after World War II if the codex was bound on the continent
                rather than by book sellers in the UK.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><sup><sup>[25]</sup></sup></a>
                The binding can be used to reveal when the manuscript was rebound into a composite manuscript but a more
                in depth study of the binding method and materials used could provide clarity.</p>
            <p>It is now housed by Carleton University&rsquo;s Archives and Special Collections (ARC) when the codex was
                rediscovered during library renovations in 201x. It has not yet been digitally catalogued by the
                university. Courses such as <em>The History of the Medieval Book</em> (taught by Professor Marc
                Saurette) that interact with and study the codex are available to undergraduate students as of 2016.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 id=conclusions>1.10 Conclusions</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>The codicology analysis of the manuscript reveals that it is a compound manuscript featuring at least two
                quires of distinct origins, and at least four bookhands. The first and largest part of the codex is of
                Spanish origin and dates from the early to mid-sixteenth century.</p>
            <p>It was created for practical use for the liturgy, suggested from the quality of the parchment used and
                the extended usage and repairs that can be observed. Possibly, it was an instructional manuscript
                intended to teach monks how to sing the eight modes of Gregorian chant, evident in the appended tonary
                (<em>see</em> Contents). It was further used as a teaching tool in that it was stitched and added to by
                amateurs, as apparent in the inconsistent quality of both later repairs and script.</p>
            <p>The manuscript received special care by its original, likely monastic, owners. It is free of insect,
                rodent, or mold damage which suggests the initial owners took care to house the manuscript
                appropriately. The extended usage and subsequent repairs signify a position of practical, yet still
                great importance to the owners.</p>
            <p>This means the codex changed hands a few times after leaving its place of origin and prior to its arrival
                at Carleton. The early modern and scholastic (rather than monastic) script found between f. 42r - 43r
                suggests an owner in between the monastery and the bookseller. This interim owner was Spanish, as they
                spelled a V for a B in medieval Latin, sounds that become indistinguishable in Spanish.<a href="#_ftn26"
                    name="_ftnref26"><sup><sup>[26]</sup></sup></a></p>
            <p>There is evidence that the codex has been rebound at least once, as it is not in its original binding.
                Missing pages, especially the &lsquo;clean&rsquo; cuts are evidence of book breaking, likely for the
                purpose of resale as individual pieces of medieval art which fetch a higher price than a book sold as a
                whole.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><sup><sup>[27]</sup></sup></a> This is most often done with
                illuminated pages, but folia of liturgical importance would also be cut and framed for religious and
                collection purposes.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><sup><sup>[28]</sup></sup></a> The final quire
                was likely appended to the end of the codex, possibly by a bookseller before it was acquired by
                Macdougall and subsequently gifted to the university.</p>
