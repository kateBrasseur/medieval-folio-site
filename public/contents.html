<h1>Part 1: Carleton Compound manuscript</h1>
<h2>Contents of Ms.1</h2>

<h3>Genre</h3>
Carleton Compound manuscript is a Liturgical Chant manuscript. Within the Christian tradition liturgy refers to worship
services. This manuscript features liturgical or Office Hours, making it an Antiphonal (includes chants called Antiphons
rather than graduals, which are sung at Mass). However, because it is a compound manuscript it also features a tonary,
feast days, and a hymnal.

<h3>Tonary</h3>
<p>
    The manuscript includes a tonary appended to the beginning. The tonary is a liturgical book that lists eight psalm
    modes of gregorian chant. This provides evidence of this manuscript as a teaching tool as tonaries were used to
    memorize chants.

<h3>Office of the Dead (Vespers)</h3>
<p>
    After the tonary the manuscript opens with the Office of the Dead at Vespers (evening prayer). It appears to follow
    the convention of Antiphonals including Antiphon and Ad Magnificat followed by a Canticle.
    The manuscript follows this common pattern for the Office of Dead:
    (Vespers) Invitatory, Antiphons, Responsory, Ad Magnificat, Canticle. Prayer of Eternal Rest. Nocturnes, etc.
