        <hr />
        <p>
            To best understand our manuscript, and indeed to make it more accessible for study, a catalogue of its
            contents is necessary. Liturgical manuscripts are notoriously difficult to categorize, so I have attempted
            to establish the contents of this medieval book to the best of my ability. There is much to learn about the
            manuscript, but my intention, as I have stated, has not been to produce a critical analysis of the contents,
            but instead to provide a resource that will bring to light its contents to place this artefact within the
            broader context of its origins and history. My hope for the future is that this effort can be put towards a
            larger study of liturgical chant manuscripts, to better understand their structure, contents, and the lives
            and devotion of those who produced them.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Genre</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
            The Carleton Antiphonary is made up of two distinct manuscripts (and possibly a distinct final leaf) but
            they
            can all be categorized generally as a liturgical chant. The first and largest of the two manuscripts (called
            part A) begins with a tonary followed by an antiphonal (a collection of antiphons, chants sung during
            canonical hours) for the Office of the Dead. This section is a Temporale, which features feasts for one half
            of the liturgical calendar and includes major events such as Lent, Holy Week, and Easter. It is common in
            French and Iberian manuscripts for the hymnal, Office of the Dead, and Office of the Virgin to appear, as
            they do in this manuscript.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> However, the Office of the
            Virgin appended to the end of the codex may not be copied by the scribes that first created it; this will be
            expanded upon in the section &ldquo;Final Leaf&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the Office of Dead the manuscript features annotations in a later <em>cursiva </em>script written on
            blank lines from the original ruling from f.42 r - 43r. This is an early modern annotation of the Credo (a
            formal statement of Christian belief) with accompanying Gregorian chant. Thereafter begins a hymnal, with
            hymns for a selection of feast days following the Temporal section of the liturgical calendar.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second and much smaller manuscript (part B), which has been bound to the end of part A, are pages from
            the Service of Tenebrae (the last three days of Holy Week leading up to Easter Day) but it is incomplete.
        </p>
        <p> But the codex&rsquo;s eclectic nature does not stop there. A distinct final leaf (featuring an antiphon for
            the Virgin Mary), and many repairs including pasted-down fragments from manuscript waste. These are all
            evidence of the continuous life of this codex over the last 500 years. This section will explore the
            liturgical contents of the Carleton Antiphonary with the goal to better understand its purpose as a
            devotional object, teaching tool, and medieval artefact throughout its ongoing history.

        <h4>Manuscript part A</h4>
        <p><strong>Tonary (f.1r - 27r)</strong></p>
        <p>The manuscript includes a tonary appended to the beginning, preceding the antiphonal. Tonaries are a type of
            liturgical book that lists the eight psalm modes of gregorian chant. These modes would be used as examples
            to instruct monks on how to sing the various modes by memory rather than to use it continuously during
            chants.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> This tonary, as a memorization tool,
            provides evidence that this manuscript was used as a teaching tool.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Antiphonal, Office of the Dead (f.27r - 42r)</strong></p>
        <p>Directly following the tonary, the manuscript opens with an Invitatory of the Office of the Dead
            (Defunctorum) set at Vespers (evening prayer and the beginning of the Office Hours). The Office of the Dead
            is recited on the feast of All Souls (November 2) and upon the death of certain individuals. According to
            Andrew Hughes&rsquo;s useful study, <em>Medieval Manuscripts for Mass and Office: a guide to their
                organization and terminology,</em> the manuscript follows the convention of Antiphonals including the
            basic structure of Antiphon and psalm, repeated 5 times, followed by the Antiphon Ad Magnificat.<a
                href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> The Office of the Dead has at least one
            folio removed between f.28v-29r. Interestingly, starting on f.42r, the parchment was left blank with only
            red stave lines present until the text resumed again on f.44r. These have since been populated in an early
            modern hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Credo (Early Modern Annotation) (f.42 r - 43r)</strong></p>
        <p>The blank musical staves from f.42r - 43r must have seemed the perfect place to copy the <em>Credo </em>onto
            the page to one early modern Christian. This copyist was likely a middle class Spanish person, likely
            secular rather than monastic, judging by the early modern <em>Cursiva </em>script they used to pen the
            <em>Credo</em>. It is not written in its entirety here, indeed the copyist has left clues of their time and
            context, eliminated a single line from the traditional <em>Credo</em>:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto ex Maria Virgine, et homo factus est.<br /> </p>
        <p>He was incarnate by the Holy Ghost out of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.<a href="#_ftn4"
                name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In Catholic doctrine, the Virgin Mary is venerated and the Immaculate Conception (the notion that Mary was
            conceived without sin) and perpetual virginity is accepted as part of their beliefs. However, many
            denominations of Christianity do not venerate Mary in the same way. Most notably is the protestant movement,
            which gradually removed Mary from her place of key importance.<a href="#_ftn5"
                name="_ftnref5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> Paleographical evidence suggests the copyist is Spanish,
            owing to the fact that they replace a V for a B, sounds that become indistinguishable in Spanish.<a
                href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a> Protestantism was not adopted in Spain
            because of the Inquisition. Therefore, the text would have had to have been copied quite a bit later than
            the original text. It was perhaps copied sometime after the mid-seventeenth century, when Spain experienced
            its first (lasting) Protestant movement. However, it is more likely even later, as prosecution on a state
            level did not cease until after 1868, following the Glorious Revolution which brought greater religious
            tolerance.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a> Of course, there is the distinct
            possibility that this copyist was a protestant of Spanish birth who fled Spain to escape inquisition. This
            could also explain how the manuscript initially left Spain.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Hymnal (f. 44r - 61v)</strong></p>
        <p>One folio is left without text and only the original ruling and black staves (f.43v). Afterwards, a hymnal
            begins. It is not uncommon for a hymnal to be bound along with an antiphonal, according to Hughes, but are
            often kept in separate sections of the same book.<a href="#_ftn8"

        <p>Below is a list of the hymns in the manuscript, in order of appearance:</p>
        <p>*In many cases additional lines of chant are added to be sung at specific canonical hours, or are
            subdivisions of a larger book. These are accounted for in the additional chants column.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The selection of hymns and degrees of importance placed on them (through a variety of unique chants for
            canonical hours) are revealing. Importantly, key figures of the Franciscan orders are most prominent,
            including St. Francis himself, but also St. Clare (of the Poor Clares, second Order of St. Francis) and
            Saint Louis the Confessor, who is honoured as one of the most powerful and influential patrons of the Third
            Order of St. Francis.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a> Therefore this
            manuscript is a liturgical chant manuscript likely copied at a Franciscan monastery. The veneration of Mary
            as a saint is also strong evidence of this, as Marian devotion is central to the Order as well as in
            Catholicism.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a> There is also a lot of space
            allocated to the Dedication of a Church with unique chants from lauds through nones, which may have been
            copied for practical purposes, such as a new church being planned or constructed. The manuscript part A ends
            where a page has been cut between it and the beginning of part B (f.61v - 62r). This page would have
            belonged to part A as the transcription cuts off the text for the Visitation of Mary at nones.</p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <h4>Manuscript part B</h4>
        <p>Selections from the Service of Tenebrae (f.62r - 64v)</p>
        <p>This manuscript features selections from the service of Tenebrae, which are held on the three days preceding
            Easter day. Manuscript part B seems to begin in an odd place, approximately halfway through first nocturnes
            of the Holy Thursday Service. We find the incipit for the <em>Lamentations of Jeremiah</em> (<em>Lamentatio
                Jeremie prophete</em>) on f.62r. This incipit begins the first reading of Holy Thursday&rsquo;s first
            nocturne service which would typically go through Lamentations 1:1 - 1:5. However, this manuscript only
            provides 1:1 and 1:2 or Aleph (Hebrew, Alef א) and Beth (Hebrew, Bet ב). This could be due to missing
            folios, as these would typically be bound together. Further evidence of this is found on f.63r as
            Lamentations 5:1 begins here. Lamentations 5:1 - 5:11 are the 3rd readings of the first nocturne on Holy
            Saturday of Tenebrae. Our manuscript lists these from f.63r - 64v. There is then evidence of another cut
            folio, manuscript part B ends there.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a> It is
            difficult to know why this was done, but it is known that early modern collectors disliked texts that
            appeared incomplete and would erase or remove pages in an effort to &ldquo;neaten&rdquo; the manuscripts.<a
                href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a> As the incipit for the Lamentations
            starts the page with a large rubricated drop capital, the collector may have judged this as visually
            &ldquo;complete&rdquo; but disregarded the contents of the manuscript that came before it and the intended
            position of the Lamentations in the service of Tenebrae. Explaining how these two unconnected manuscripts
            came to be one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Final Leaf</h4>
        <p>Antiphon for the Immaculate Conception of Virgin Mary (f.65r - 65v)</p>
        <p>This final page seems to have been removed from another manuscript and bound to the rest of this codex,
            perhaps as an attempt to reconstruct the structure of the Temporale, which features the Office of the Dead,
            hymnal, and the Office of the Virgin. But it is likely this leaf is distinct from both part A and B of the
            manuscript from codicological evidence (see <em>palaeography: bookhand 4</em>). The beginning and ending of
            the leaf are both cut off and have no match within the rest of the manuscript. Again, this may be an example
            of early modern alteration (or the strategic removal of leaves) to make the text appear more complete. There
            is also the possibility that this leaf may be an early modern imitation of the original bookhand, but there
            is currently not enough evidence to support this theory.<a href="#_ftn13"

        <h3>2.3 Corrections and Annotations</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>The Carleton Antiphonary has a rich variety of corrections and annotations, some contemporary and others more
            modern. The contemporary annotations are chiefly corrections and guidewords, but make up the majority of the
            annotations found in the book. Another kind of contemporary annotation can be found in the manuscript,
            however. On f.30v (during the Office of the Dead) a three-line stave and alternate musical notation for the
            <em>Kyrie </em>was added to the bottom margin of the folio. This music is more malismatic than the
            simplified version on the page above it which could indicate it was for use during special occasions (a
            notable death, for example) or by more practiced students.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, on f.37r there is an early modern annotation of a four-lined stave and musical notation also
            concerned with the Kyrie, in the bottom margin of the folio. This annotation is an extension of the chant
            rather than a variation. We see this practice of extending the notation in the top exterior margin of the
            same folio, where they seem to be clarifying the close-together and difficult to read notation found on the
            line below (figure 18).<br />
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The contemporary hand has added another musical notation to the exterior margin of f.28r, but this time there
            has been no attempt to make it blend in with the rest of the book. It is written on its side, features a
            single line stave and writes out the verse &ldquo;Audivi vocem de caelo dicentem mihi&rdquo;.<a
                href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup></a> This was meant to be added before the
            Antiphon Ad Magnificat but the rubricated Ꝟ for Versus was never inked. Therefore, it had to have been added
            later in the margins (Figure 19).</p>

        <p>Beginning on folio 27r, a modern hand has written in expansions above abbreviated words in pencil (Figure

            tuaꝪ&rdquo; on f.27v. It appears the annotator intended to correct the Office of Dead, as the ammendations
            begin immediately after the Incipit for the Office. However, only three pages were ultimately marked, ending
            on f.28r.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Conclusions</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>This study of the manuscript&rsquo;s contents provides information about the book as an artefact, detailing
            its origins and history over the past 500 years. We understand that the first manuscript (part A) that makes
            up the whole of this compound manuscript was created as a teaching tool as well as a devotional book as it
            opens with a tonary. Tonaries would have been added to instruct monks on the eight modes of Gregorian chant.
            Furthermore, the Office of the Dead and hymnal provide us with insight into its creators. We know that it
            was created by a Franciscan order as prominent hymns are dedicated to notable figures of the order such as
            St. Francis, St. Clare, and Saint Louis the Confessor.</p>
        <p>Sometime after the manuscript left monastic hands, a Spanish middle-class owner possessed it which is evident
            through the quick humanist script they wrote with, and the replacement of Vs for Bs (sounds that become
            indistinguishable in Spanish) in the <em>Credo </em>which they copied into the blank staves of the
            manuscript.</p>
        <p>The second manuscript (part B) that makes up the compound manuscript is the result of early modern
            collections appending pages to the manuscripts to make them appear more complete. Therefore the first page
            features the Incipit for the <em>Lamentations of Jeremiah</em> despite these readings appearing well into
            the service of Tenebrae. The final leaf, distinct from the rest of the manuscript, again reveals the
            workings of early modern collectors who attempted to make the book appear more complete or
            &lsquo;neat&rsquo; as the final page may have been considerably damaged.</p>
        <p>The presence of annotations throughout the manuscript, both contemporary and modern, demonstrate the care and
            continuous use of this manuscript throughout its life. The contemporary annotations illustrate the special
            and ongoing care received by the book by its monastic creators. The early modern additions, particularly the
            <em>Credo </em>on f.42r - 43r, indicate the manuscript left monastic hands and was held by a wealthy, likely
            secular (based on the <em>cursiva </em>script), individual. It was then acquired by early modern collectors
            who altered the manuscript. Modern annotations reveal the book was used anew as a studying and devotional
            tool, as the annotator attempted to expand the Latin abbreviations of the original bookhand.</p>
        <p>This examination of the manuscript&rsquo;s contents gives evidence of the continuous life of this medieval
            book for over 500 years since its creation. Its purpose as an artefact changed as its owners changed, and
            was at once a devotional object, teaching tool, and medieval artefact throughout its rich history. I hope
            this effort will contribute to its further study and care as access to its history and contents, including
            its structure and distinct parts become more available through this digital project.</p>
